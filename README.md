# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard  

## Overview  
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into **road accidents and casualties** for the years **2021 and 2022**. It allows users to analyze accident trends, severity, vehicle types involved, and accident conditions (road type, light, and location).  

The dashboard aims to provide help to stakeholders (e.g., traffic authorities, policymakers, safety analysts) by letting them identify key problem areas and make **data-driven decisions** for road safety improvements.

## Objectives  
This dashboard is designed to analyze:  
- Yearly comparison of casualties and accidents (Current Year vs Previous Year).  
- Breakdown of casualties by **severity, vehicle type, road type, area, and time of day**.  
- Trends and **geographical insights** for better decision-making.
